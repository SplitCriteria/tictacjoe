# Overview
Welcome! This programming exercise contains the code to make a basic game in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Some code is in PHP in order to track user metrics.

# Files
* **game.php** The webpage which contains the structure of the game board and all the widgets (i.e. buttons, text, selectors) which the user will interact with
* **styles.css** A file in the CSS syntax which applies styles to all the webpages
* **data.js** A Javascript file which stores the data on the user's computer to track certain metrics (e.g. win/loss count, time of last visit)
* **main.js** This is the heart of the game - this Javascript file manages the gameplay, tracking metrics, etc.
* **opponent.js** This Javascript file is the brains of the opponent. Can you make an opponent here which will beat a human player? Good luck!
* **README.md** This file! When posted on Github, a README.md file (which is written in Markdown syntax) will display on the front page.

# Plea for Help!
Can you help make the opponent smart enough to beat a human opponent? You can download these files to your computer, edit 'opponent.js', test out your changes, and then suggest an update via a 'Pull Request' on github. This is the foundation for collaborative coding!
